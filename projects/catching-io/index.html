			<h2>Not A Raspberry PI</h2>

			<p>Catching IO is a <b>Rhythm Game</b> inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJMax" target="_blank">DJMax</a>. We used an Atmel microcontroller for programming and configured the layout on a basic breadboard.</p>

			<h4>About</h4>
			<p>I had been taking a class about embedded systems, which probably gave me much more hands-on experience than than any other class that I've taken. For a lot of the projects, we did basic stuff like configuring buttons/LEDs and test their connection. Since more of my prior experience &ndash;&ndash; and Jessica's &ndash;&ndash; had been with software, I found that writing the logic behind our projects were a piece of cake. The hardware, however... man. <b>Soldering is difficult!</b> Seriously. Kudos to the people who do this kind of stuff daily. I found soldering to be one of the most difficult things to do. For every mistake you make, you need to spend thrice the effort to fix it. And I made a lot of mistakes.</p>

			<br>

			<p>For our final project we were free to do whatever we wanted, and since I had been getting in the groove of making games, I figured I'd make one for this case too. But it's hard to design a game around a simple 2x16 LCD display or no display at all. I could display commands and look for user response, but that would make for a pretty boring game. Then all of a sudden, something hit me that nobody had really thought about.</p>

			<br>

			<h3 align="center">I can turn the LCD display sideways!</h3>

			<br>

			<p>Something as simple as that. By choosing to make a rhythm game, I made full use of the long, narrow screen. I then used LED lights and sound to let the player know when they hit a character successfully. Not too shabby if you ask me.</p>
