			<p>Man this feels so <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meta" target="_blank">meta</a>. <b>Wesley's Website</b> is not only an ongoing project that tests my ability to design, implement, and manage a quality website, but also a way for me to practice my writing and teaching skills. My website is written in <b>HTML</b> / <b>CSS</b>, and served using <b>Apache Web Server</b>. If you're not busy, stay a while and check out the topics I have in store!</p>

			<h4>About</h4>
			<p>This all started when my brother left his old computer in my possession. I could have left it out to gather dust, but instead I took the opportunity to make a server out of it. I performed a memory wipe to prepare my new toy for an Ubuntu installation. I think it was then that I realized that having a personal server opens up so many possibilities.</p>

			<p>A while passed, and it was only after college that I thought about making a website. I hadn't taken any courses about web development from school, so I figured that this was a pretty good opportunity for me to learn something new. The people I met don't think much of web development, but I think they make quite an impact. In the digital age, every company needs a website. And I like writing stuff anyway, so I spent a couple of days learning <span class="tooltip">HTML<span class="tooltiptext">HyperText Markup Language</span></span> and <span class="tooltip">CSS<span class="tooltiptext">Cascading StyleSheets</span></span> and made this website.</p>
