			<h2>The Plot</h2>

			<p>The protagonist (Goo scientist) creates a substance that acts as a perfect clean fuel source.  As the fuel becomes widespread across the globe it causes long term cerebral and genetic problems. These issues do not become apparent until years of exposure. Around the 5th year of use, the goo scientist collaborates with another scientist (Time Scientist) to create a machine that allows them to go into the past and fix the problem before it begins. Years pass before the time machine is finished and global civilization begins to crumble because the goo is slowly turning people into feral mutants. Unfortunately before they can enact their plan to save the future by going to the past, the northwest region of the United States falls (the region where the time machine was being developed) and it complicates the situation. The goo scientist begins to suffer from amnesia because of his minor exposure to the substance throughout the years. In a last ditch effort to save the day the Goo scientist heads to northwest area to find his research partner and finally enact their plan. By the time the Goo scientist meets up with the Time scientist he no longer remembers the plan to save the future because of his amnesia, so both scientist have to recreate the plan and enact it at the same time. The Goo scientist must also find notes he has written to himself to better recreate the plan to save the future. Goo scientist will travel back in time at certain key moments to stop or create events in history to stop the eventually creation of the substance.</p>

			<br>

			<p>Two endings have been thought of, one dark and one happier. If the player lacks a certain completion percentage, the protagonist will have to go back in time and kill himself in order to stop the Goo from being created. If the player meets the completion requirement then the protagonist delivers a new improved formula for the goo that is harmless.</p>
