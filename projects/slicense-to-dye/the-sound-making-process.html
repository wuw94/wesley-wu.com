			<h2>The Sound Making Process</h2>
			<h4>What exactly do I do?</h4>
			<p>Contrary to the belief of most people in <span class="tooltip"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/vgdcuci/" target="_blank">VGDC</a><span class="tooltiptext">Video Game Development Club</span></span>, sound design isn't just composing the notes to a track. Here's my general schedule for implementing a sound from start to finish:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Analyze: What type of sound am I looking for?</li>
				<li>Initialize: How will I create that type of sound?</li>
				<li>Compose the score for the song, or manipulate sound files to produce the sound.</li>
				<li>Mixing: How can I make a sound or song feel more intense if required?</li>
				<li>Mastering: How can I reduce the file size without hurting the sound quality?</li>
				<li>Engineering: How can I optimize the quality of sound for both headphones and the android speaker (it's an android app, after all)</li>
				<li>Implementation: Working with code to make sure the sound works as intended in-game</li>
			</ul>

			<br>

			<p>As a general rule, expect a major overhaul in sound production every time I put my headphones on.</p>

			<br>

			<h4>How do I do what I do?</h4>

			<p>I use a <span class="tooltip">DAW<span class="tooltiptext">Digital Audio Workspace</span></span> called <a href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/" target="_blank">FL Studio</a>. First I need to flesh out the mood for our game. We have 4 worlds in the SLicense to Dye. For each world, I first have to figure out what instruments best portray the world's atmosphere. The styles must differ enough to show that these are indeed different worlds, but not to the extent where it feels like a completely different game. I accomplished this by assigning relatively different instrument schemes, while retaining their frequency range, and keeping a similar note style between each world. You'll notice these small peculiarities if you listen to the soundtrack.</p>

			<br>

			<h4>Tutorial Theme</h4>

			<p>I wanted this world to feel like attending a classical school. After all, this world is provided to the player as a means to learn how common mechanics in the game work. I used a Classical Rock drum set, Piano, Flute, and the most important ingredient, the Xylophone. When I was in a music class for my elementary school, we learned how to play Xylophones, so it made sense to use this instrument.</p>

			<br>

			<h4>Vampire Theme</h4>

			<p>A classic vampire theme involves eerie organs and detuned pianos, but I felt that the said classical approach was not fitting for our fast paced game. I went with a Dance drum set, Electric Guitar, a high pitched Bell and Organ. Note the Dance drum set, which I used to create a mood which was tense yet upbeat.</p>

			<br>

			<h4>Military Theme</h4>

			<p>I wanted to give this world an upbeat atmosphere, but also stress the importance of accuracy. I went with some instruments you would find in marching band, such as a Marching Band drum set, Clarinet, and Viola.</p>

			<br>

			<h4>Space Theme</h4>

			<p>If you've ever tried our game, you'll notice that our last world is insanely hard. I added in a slight jazz & funk to the music so the player wouldn't feel as tense. For this theme I wanted a tech-y theme, yet not too similar to <span class="tooltip">EDM<span class="tooltiptext">Electronic Dance Music</span></span>. I ended up using a drum set that I glitched the sounds of, in addition to several Oscillators and Synthesizers.</p>

			<br>

			<p>And there you have it! The recipe for making SLicense to Dye music.</p>
