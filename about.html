			<h2>Hey there!</h2>

			<p>Here's my <a href="resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> if you want to jump straight into it.</p>

			<br>

			<h3 align="center">Creativity is my passion in life</h3>

			<br>

			<p>I'm a <span class="tooltip">CSE<span class="tooltiptext">Computer Science and Engineering</span></span> graduate from the University of California, Irvine. Right after graduation, I took a break, and visited my relatives in Asia. Recently, I've been spending my time by honing in my knowledge of all-things-computers that I didn't get to learn during my time in college. That's stuff like:</p>

			<br>

			<ul>
				<li>Game Development</li>
				<li>Full Stack Web Development</li>
				<li>UNIX / Terminal / bash</li>
				<li>Server Management</li>
			</ul>

			<br>

			<h4>Outside of Computer Science</h4>

			<p>I love to make <b>stuff</b>. Literally anything. Especially stuff that's <b>art-related</b>. Did you know I'm actually a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/WasoonMusic" target="_blank">composer</a>?</p>

			<br>

			<h4>This website</h4>

			<p>More than just an HTML/CSS project, I'm trying my hand at web design, which I originally never touched upon. I feel that modern websites (the ones where you only scroll down) are actually quite difficult to get around. The more <b>content</b> you try to fit onto a page, the more likely your audience will be lost. The more <b>flair</b> you add to a page, the more confusing things become. Every ounce of free time is precious.</p>

			<br>

			<p>I also <span class="tooltip"><b>break the text</b><span class="tooltiptext">Adding a full space between chunks of text.</span></span> pretty often. Here's why:</p>

			<p>When reading, peoples' eyes are constantly looking for something to anchor to. It gives the reader a sense of stability. If you stare at a wall of text, you're probably going to lose track of which line you were reading. I know because I'm one of those people. I <b>love learning</b>, but I'm not so much a fan of reading. But when I started writing posts for my own website, I realized that this problem could be solved simply by breaking the text.</p>

			<br>

			<p>This website is designed with the above concepts in mind. For your convenience, here are a couple of the features employed in my website:</p>

			<br>

			<ul>
				<li>This website is designed to display properly with any dimension.</li>
				<li>Text in <a href="http://producemadesimple.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/orange-web-1024x768.jpg" target="_blank">orange</a> are always links. Links taking you outside of this website will always be opened in a new window.</li>
				<li>Text with <span class="tooltip">dotted underlines<span class="tooltiptext">A dotted line below a text.</span></span> are tooltips. Hover over them to read what they mean. I understand that most people don't want to google every new term, so don't worry! I'll do the explaining.</li>
				<li>There are a lot of <b>bolded</b> text. For people who get lost in text easily, these are your anchors.</li>
			</ul>

			<br>

			<h4>Concluding remarks</h4>

			<p>I hope the contents of this website help you get to know me a little better. If you'd like to have a little chat, or even ask a simple question, I'm all ears!</p>
