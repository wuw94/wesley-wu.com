			<h2>The Only Sound Guy</h2>
			<h4>Let me bring you up to speed...</h4>
			<p>When I was in high school, many clubs were a <span class="tooltip">pyramid scheme<span class="tooltiptext">In a pyramid scheme, people in the upper layers typically profit while people in the lower layers typically lose money.</span></span> in which the club leaders were only looking for a fancy name to put on their college application. As such, these clubs headed in no particular direction and served only the purpose of making somebody look good to prospective colleges. That is why, during my first year of college, I didn't join any clubs.</p>

			<br>

			<p>But I later learned that clubs in college are different. They aren't formed for somebody to look good. Clubs in college are formed purely for <b>passion</b> and <b>activity</b>. It was the winter of my second quarter, and I had been playing around with composing and music production back then. My friend Brianna saw this and told me about a club that was looking for sound designers. This club is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/vgdcuci/" target="_blank">Video Game Development Club at UCI (VGDC)</a>. I thought that, well, it probably wouldn't hurt to check it out. So I did.</p>

			<h4>The only sound guy</h4>

			<p>After joining for a while I learned that I'm apparently the only sound guy in <span class="tooltip">VGDC<span class="tooltiptext">Video Game Development Club</span></span>. Our team's artist, <a href="http://maxrchung.com/" target="_blank">JaMax</a>, was in a similar boat. He tells me how intense life is as the only artist on our team. I would assume so, since many of the other teams had stacked their art department in order to boost their game's appearance. I understood the situation as: he was essentially a <b>one-man-army</b> competing against a couple of <b>more-than-one-man-army</b>'s.</p>

			<br>

			<p>I was also a case of 'the only' for our team too, but I didn't have to compete with anybody since literally nobody knew anything about music production. I actually kind of enjoyed it. People generally viewed my work with higher praise because sound production was such a rarity. They would say stuff like <i>'wow, gee, you made all these sounds?'</i>. Yeah dude, good times. I'd been making music as a hobby since middle school, so it didn't feel particularly difficult.</p>

			<br>

			<h4>Wrapping up</h4>

			<p>I want to point out the benefits of solo-department work. Since both JaMax and I did unique work in our team, we had more control over how the game would feel. In VGDC, teams with multiple artists generally suffer from clashing styles. It's pretty difficult, in those cases, to pick one over the other. So I'm pretty glad that I had this kind of opportunity of having full-control over my work. It also forced me to lead myself, which I think is a good thing too.</p>
