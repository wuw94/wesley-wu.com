			<h2>Why I Used .ogg</h2>
			<h4>The problem</h4>
			<p>As soon as I jumped into this project, I noticed that there was a problem with looping sounds. Even if I edited the sound file so the cutoff is at a perfect timing on a computer, there was a noticeable delay when we built the project and ran it on a mobile device. I did a little research. Turns out that phones have to load up the sound file every time before playing, even if that sound was just played. So I started thinking about the basic ways to solve this issue:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Always have the next song preloaded so that it's available right when the current song ends.</li>
				<li>Break our song into separate parts so the load time for each one is less noticeable.</li>
			</ul>

			<br>

			<h4>Preloading the next song</h4>

			<p>For most phones, this was a pretty good solution. However, for my low-end benchmark phone, weird things started happening. I supposed it was a problem of not having enough access memory to work with. The end result was a timing worse than what we originally had.</p>

			<br>

			<h4>Breaking song into separate parts</h4>
			<p>This was highly impractical because we would have so many sound files. Like upwards to a hundred or so. But I tried it anyway, and the result was still pretty bad. No matter what I did, there would always be a lingering delay in which the phone has to load the next song.</p>

			<br>

			<h4>Then I stumbled upon .ogg</h4>

			<p>It turns out that .ogg loads a lot faster than the file types we were originally using (.wav and .mp3). There was still maybe a 0.1s delay, but it was a lot less noticeable than the delay we had before, which was approximately 0.5s</p>
