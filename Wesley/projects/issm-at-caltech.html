			<h2>Mapping Global Warming</h2>

			<p>ISSM, or <a href="https://issm.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Ice Sheet System Model</a> is a collaboration between NASA and UCI. It's purpose is to map the surface of ice caps in Greenland & Antarctica with the goal of proving or disproving the effects of global warming.</p>

			<br>

			<p>My task was to create a visualization tool for our data &ndash;&ndash; the height of ice as measured by helicopter patrol &ndash;&ndash; and its triangulation. I implemented a program with three key features: zooming, region highlighting, and information toggling. I wrote my program in <b>Python</b> using a plotting library called <b>Matplotlib</b></p>

			<h4>About</h4>
			<p>It was my second year, just before Spring quarter, and I had been looking around for some opportunities to do research at UCI. I asked one of my Computer Science professors &ndash;&ndash; the notorious Dr. Pattis &ndash;&ndash; about it, and although he wasn't looking for student researchers, he did introduce me to somebody who was. So I gave him a visit to see what kind of research he was looking for.</p>

			</div>

			<br>

			<p>He's a pretty great guy. I joined a bit late, but he told me it wasn't a problem. He had been working on three concurrent projects:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Astronomy</li>
				<li>Global Warming</li>
				<li>Biology</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I chose to work on the Global Warming project because I already had most of the experience required for that kind of work. Then he hooked me up with a researcher at NASA who eventually gave me the specifications for the program I would be making.</p>

			<br>

			<p>This research was actually supposed to be a two person job. I was supposed to have teammate &ndash;&ndash; whose name I will not reveal &ndash;&ndash; but the professor and I lost contact with him for the entire project. Funny thing is, I forgot he even existed until I looked back on my emails. I still did got the job done though, albeit with a few extra all-nighters.</p>
